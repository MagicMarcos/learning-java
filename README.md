# learning-java
<p>This repository will be used track small projects as I work towards learning Java.</p>

## Reflections and Descrition: 
<p>As a strongly typed language, Java poses some distinct challenges for someone coming from a JavaScript background. 
Although it is a positive that Classes and OOP are familiar concepts that help keep things less "foreign at first".</p>
<p>However, it's important to remember: JavaScript and Java have about as much in common as "cat" and "catfish".</p>

## Todo: 
<p>Adding README files to all projects as well as other notes and take aways.</p>

### Errors and Bugs
<p>If something behaves unexpectedly, it is likely a bug. Create an issue and report it <a href="https://github.com/MagicMarcos/DreamOn/issues">here</a>  </p>
<p>Suggestions and comments are also welcome.</p>
